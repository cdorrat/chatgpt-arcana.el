# ChatGPT-Arcana

## About

ðŸ”® Put ChatGPT in your Emacs and give yourself arcane powers ðŸ”®

ChatGPT-Arcana is an Emacs package that lets you chat with ChatGPT directly from emacs, operate on your code or text, generate `eshell` commands from natural language, and more.

## Usage

There are various interactive functions available. Some of them even work. This package provides the following functionality:

- Chat with GPT in Emacs with `chatgpt-arcana-chat-start-chat` or `chatgpt-arcana-chat-start-chat-with-system-prompt`. Automatically sends the selected region, if there is one.
- Chat buffer auto-naming (modify prompt with custom var `chatgpt-arcana-generated-buffer-name-prompt`).
- Chat session autosave and automatic file naming (disable with custom var`chatgpt-arcana-chat-autosave-enabled`, modify save directory with `chatgpt-arcana-chat-autosave-directory`).
- Automatically handles token overflow for chats with several available strategies (`chatgpt-arcana-token-overflow-strategy` and `chatgpt-arcana-token-overflow-token-goal`)
- Operate on your text or code with `chatgpt-arcana-replace-region`,  `chatgpt-arcana-insert-at-point-with-context`, and several others.
- Use the `spell` eshell command to convert natural language into shell commands (when including `extras/chatgpt-arcana-eshell`).
- Automatically fix errors at point from `flycheck` or `flymake` with `chatgpt-arcana-autofix` (when including `extras/chatgpt-arcana-autofix`).
- Automatically write commit messages with `chatgpt-arcana-commitmsg` (when including `extras/chatgpt-arcana-commitmsg`)
- [Very experimental] Create an agent that can use tools including web search and code eval with `query-loop` (when including `extras/chatgpt-arcana-react`)

## Installation

ChatGPT-Arcana isnâ€™t on melpa or elpa. You can use use-package to install from github:

```elisp
(use-package chatgpt-arcana
  :straight (:host github :repo "CarlQLange/ChatGPT-Arcana.el" :files ("*.el"))
  :init (setq chatgpt-arcana-api-key "your-api-key-here"))
```

You may wish to use `.authinfo` or similar to hold your API key. You can do this by creating or adding to your `~/.authinfo` file like the following:

```
machine chat.openai.com login YOUR_CHATGPT_EMAIL_HERE password YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

and using the line

```elisp
(setq chatgpt-arcana-api-key (auth-source-pick-first-password
                                              :host "chat.openai.com"))
```

in your config.

My own config adds a few extra parts that don't need to be part of the package.

```elisp
(use-package chatgpt-arcana
  :straight (:host github :repo "CarlQLange/ChatGPT-Arcana.el" :files ("*.el"))
  :init (setq chatgpt-arcana-api-key "your-api-key-here")
  :config 
  (use-package all-the-icons
    :config
    (add-to-list 'all-the-icons-mode-icon-alist
                 '(chatgpt-arcana-chat-mode all-the-icons-octicon "comment-discussion" :height 1.0 :v-adjust -0.1 :face all-the-icons-purple)))

(defun chatgpt-arcana-generate-prompt-shortcuts ()
  "Generate a list of hydra commands for `chatgpt-arcana-common-prompts-alist'."
  (mapcar (lambda (prompt)
            (let* ((identifier (car prompt))
                   (label (capitalize (symbol-name identifier)))
                   (key (concat "s" (substring (symbol-name identifier) 0 1)))
                   (command `(,key
                              (lambda () (interactive)
                                (chatgpt-arcana-query,(cdr prompt)))
                              ,label)))
              command))
          chatgpt-arcana-common-prompts-alist))
  
  (use-package pretty-hydra
    :config
    (eval `(pretty-hydra-define chatgpt-arcana-hydra (:color blue :quit-key "q" :title "ChatGPT Arcana")
             ("Query"
              (("a" chatgpt-arcana-query "Query")
               ("r" chatgpt-arcana-replace-region "Replace region"))
              "Insert"
              (("i" chatgpt-arcana-insert-at-point-with-context "At point with context")
               ("I" chatgpt-arcana-insert-at-point "At point")
               ("j" chatgpt-arcana-insert-after-region "Before region")
               ("J" chatgpt-arcana-insert-before-region "After region"))
              "Chat"
              (("c" chatgpt-arcana-start-chat "Start chat"))
              "Shortcuts"
              (,@(chatgpt-arcana-generate-prompt-shortcuts))))))

  (map! :leader
        :prefix ("[" . "ChatGPT")
        :desc "Start chat" :g "c" #'chatgpt-arcana-start-chat
        :desc "Start chat" :g "[" #'chatgpt-arcana-start-chat
        :desc "Open Hydra" :g "h" #'chatgpt-arcana-hydra/body))
```

You are going to want to add a keymap of your own, that's for sure :)

I have to stress at this point that this package is very new, and I only wrote it to scratch an itch. Sorry if it turns you into a chicken or something.

## Requirements

You will need to have an API key from OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 language model to use this package, and set it as `chatgpt-arcana-api-key`. You can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website. Depending on how much you use the package, the API cost may vary.

I strongly recommend setting a low usage limit on your account to stop runaway spending. The default model is quite cheap but it costs nothing to be prudent.

## Limitations

I have done exactly zero work in terms of compatibility. It works on my machine, sometimes. Maybe it'll even work on yours. Also, even though ChatGPT is pretty much the largest computing leap since the iPhone, it has its own limitations. Particularly, I've noticed it's pretty terrible at writing org-mode - I guess due to a lack of source data. Hence, the `chatgpt-arcana-chat-mode` is based on Markdown.
